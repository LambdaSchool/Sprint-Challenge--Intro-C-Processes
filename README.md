# Sprint-Challenge: Intro to C and Processes

Complete both tasks below.

_The code for the second task needs a Unix-like environment to work! That includes
Linux, macos, Cygwin, WSL, BSD, etc._

If you want to test if your environment is set up for it, compile and run the
[testdir.c](examples/testdir.c) program in the `examples/` directory. (You can
type `make` in the `examples/` directory.) It should print `Testing: PASS`.

## Task 1

### Short Answer Questions

Add your answers inline, below, with your pull request.

1. List all of the main states a process may be in at any point in time on a standard Unix system. Briefly explain what each of these states means.

~ Blocked: The process needs some sort of command to continue; generally from user input, such as a mouse click or keystroke.

~ Created: This is the initial state of a process. It sits idle waiting to be brought into scheduling to eventually execute a function.

~ Ready: The process has been sent to memory, and is waiting to be executed via the CPU.

~ Running: The CPU is running the instructions for the given process.

~ Terminated: The process has been commanded to exit.

~ Wait: The process just waits until it is given another command.


2. What is a zombie process? How does one get created? How does one get destroyed?

Ooooooohhhhh, zombies!!!

A zombie process is a normal process that was terminated by the CPU, yet it remains in the terminal to supposedly be executed again. Whoops! They are created when a parent process forks a child process, and the child ends up terminated before the parent can call wait(). This causes a resource leak because it is eating up memory in the queue even though it is not being used. The OS should have some sort of process or function built in to handle leaks by exiting the zombie process - gotta keep that memory free!


3. What are some of the benefits of working in a compiled language versus a non-compiled language? More specifically, what benefits are there to be had from taking the extra time to compile our code?

Complied languages are generally waaaay faster, which is great for performance. They also tend to work closer to the computer, which only assists with the higher level of performance. To further capitalize on the performance aspect, the compiled file can be run over and over again without having to be run through an interpreter and _then_ compiled to run. 

## Task 2

Write a program in C, `lsls.c`, that prints out a directory listing for the
directory the user specifies on the command line. If the user does not specify a
directory, print out the contents of the current directory, which is called `.`.

### Example runs:

```
$ ./lsls
.
..
lsls.c
lsls

$ ./lsls /home/exampleuser
.
..
.config
.vim
.yarnrc
.bashrc
foo.c
.vscode
Downloads
.gitconfig
.bash_history
.viminfo
src
```

**Hint**: Start by just printing out the contents of the current directory `.`,
and then add the command line parsing later after you have it working.

### General approach

_You are expected to use Google to find examples of how to use these functions.
Also see [Details](#details), below._

1. Call `opendir()`.
2. Then repeatedly call `readdir()`--printing the filenames as you go--until it
   lets you know there are no more directory entries by returning `NULL`.
3. Then call `closedir()`.

You don't have to write the three functions, above. They're _system calls_ built
into the OS.

### Details

You will be using functionality included in `<dirent.h>`. This header file holds
the declarations for `DIR`, `struct dirent`, `opendir()`, `readdir()`, and
`closedir()`, below.

* `DIR *opendir(char *path)`: This function opens the directory named in `path`
  (e.g. `.`) and returns a pointer to a variable of type `DIR` that will be used
  later. If there is an error, `opendir()` returns `NULL`.
  
  _You should check for errors. If there is one, print an error message and exit
  (using the `exit()` function)._

* `struct dirent *readdir(DIR *d)`: Reads the next directory entry from the
  `DIR` returned by `opendir()`. Returns the result as a pointer to a `struct
  dirent` (see below). Returns `NULL` if there are no more directory entires.

* `closedir(DIR *d)`: Close a directory (opened previously with `opendir()`)
  when you're done with it.

The `struct dirent *` returned by `readdir()` has the following fields in it:

```c
struct dirent {
  ino_t  d_ino       // file serial number
  char   d_name[]    // file name, a string
};
```

(You don't need to declare this `struct dirent` type. It's already included in
`<dirent.h>`.)

For output, you should print the field `d_name` from your `struct dirent *`
variable, e.g.

```c
struct dirent *ent;

// ... some of your code ...

ent = readdir(d);

printf("%s\n", ent->d_name);
```

To parse the command line, you'll have to look at `argc` and `argv` specified in
your `int main(int argc, char **argv)` function. Example code to print all
command line arguments can be found in [commandline.c](examples/commandline.c).
Modify that example to look at the command line parameters, if any, and pass
those to `opendir()`.

### Stretch Goal: Print file size in bytes

Modify the program to print out the file size in bytes as well as the name.

Example output (suggestion: use `%10lld` to print the size in a field of width
10):

```
$ ./lsls
    224  .
    992  ..
   1722  lsls.c
   8952  lsls
```

You'll need to use the `stat()` call in `<sys/stat.h>`.

* `int stat(char *fullpath, struct stat *buf)`: For a given full path to a file
  (i.e. the path passed to `opendir()` following by a `/` followed by the name
  of the file in `d_name`), fill the fields of a `struct stat` that you've
  pointed to. Returns `-1` on error.

  ```c
  // Example stat() usage

  struct stat buf;

  stat("./lsls.c", &buf);

  printf("file size is %lld\n", buf.st_size);
  ```

### Stretch Goal: Mark Directories

Instead of a size in bytes for a directory (which is marginally useful), replace
the number with the string `<DIR>`.

Example output:

```
$ ./lsls
     <DIR>  .
     <DIR>  ..
      1717  lsls.c
      8952  lsls
```

The `st_mode` field in the `struct stat` buffer holds information about the file
permissions and type of file.

If you bitwise-AND the value with `S_IFDIR` and get a non-zero result, the file
is a directory.

(If you bitwise-AND the value with `S_IFREG` and get a non-zero result, the file
is a regular file, as opposed to a device node, symbolic link, hard link,
directory, named pipe, etc.)
