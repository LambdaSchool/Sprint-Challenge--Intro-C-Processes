**1. List all of the main states a process may be in at any point in time on a standard Unix system. Briefly explain what each of these states means.**

    Running:
        The process is active and functioning. Taking space in memory and using system resources.

    Waiting:
        The process is idling, still in memory and resources. It is waiting for a signal or communication from another process to continue or change state. 

    Stopped: 
        Process that is killed by a either a user signal or signal from another process. Will have an exit status. Has stopped using memory space and removed from process table

    Zombie:
        Processs that is stopped. Ususally a child process. But it is still occuying memory space but not actively using 
        system resources. The parent program needs it thats why it kept in the process table. 



**2. What is a zombie process?**
    Zombie process is a dead child process that sustains itself on the process table after it returns before the parent so, most often because the parent process has called wait(). 


**3. How does a zombie process get created? How does one get destroyed?**
    Zombie processes are a result of programs not managing child processes from forks correctly. 
    The parent does not call wait on the child making it return before the parent killing it prematurely and creating a zombie. 
    When the system calls wait to read the dead processâ€™s exit status the parent process gets information from the dead process. After wait() is called, the zombie process is completely removed from memory and destroyed.


**4. What are some of the benefits of working in a compiled language versus a non-compiled language? More specifically, what benefits are there to be had from taking the extra time to compile our code?**
